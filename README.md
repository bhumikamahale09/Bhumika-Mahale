# Hey There!👋
## 🚀 About me 
🎓I am Bhumika Mahale, a Full Stack Web Developer with solid expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

🏆I’ve gained practical experience working with tools and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ReactJS, Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL. I enjoy developing web applications that combine aesthetic design with efficient functionality.

🥇I have also completed training in Advanced Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate, and have worked on several practical projects during my internship and training. These include a Digital Medicine Tracker, Library Management System using Maven, OTP Sender, Voter System, and various CRUD-based web applications that strengthened my skills in full stack development and real-world problem-solving.

📌I'm passionate about learning new technologies and constantly sharpening my development skills.
Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring my creative side through painting, sketching, and dancing. I have a deep passion for traveling, especially going on trips with friends to explore new places and cultures. I love capturing moments through photography and creating videos to document and share those experiences. I have good communication skills, adaptability, teamwork, time management, flexibility and a problem-solving mindset, which help me thrive in both collaborative and independent environments.

🎯I’m always eager to take on new challenges, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow both professionally and personally.
